# Set up

1. Make sure that you have google chrome installed and ensure that the chromedriver
version is the same as your chrome installation. To ensure this go to this website:
https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=76.0.3809.126/
and download the appropriate version. You can find your chrome version in Settings - About Google Chrome.

2. Next, add your LinkedIn username and password to the credentials file so that
the application can login. The application will not make any posts or transfer any data.
